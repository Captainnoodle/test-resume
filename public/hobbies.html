				<p>
					After completing a Front-end development boot camp in 2023, coding has
					become my passion with a particular interest in CSS, which I like to
					call the makeup of the front-end.

				<h3><u>Chess</u></h3>

				<p>
					I recently started playing chess and even bought a book. I attend a
					chess club on Mondays. Although I'm currently on a losing streak, I'm
					slowly improving and still enjoying the game.

				<h3><u>Singing</u></h3>

				<p>
					Singing has always been a passion of mine. As a child, I was part of
					choirs at school and church. Recently, I started attending open mics
					and am now undergoing vocal training to improve my performances.
